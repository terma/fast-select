 * but impact is really small
 * <h3>Rules for implementations</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Should immutable until you need to cover really special
 * case but in that way you need to worry about side effects</li>
 * <li>Method of requests will be called many times on data set, as result
 * better to keep implementations as <code>final</code> to reduce performance
 * penalties, however impact is really small</li>
 * <li>Implement {@link Object#toString()} for easy debug</li>
 * <li>Implement {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)} for easy testing
 * as in general request classes don't expose data</li>
 * </ul>
